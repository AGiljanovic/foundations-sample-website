    <p> Hello there, user. <br>
        On this website you can enter a color of your choice, and a square showing the said colour will appear!

    <!-- when the user submits this form, it will send the information submitted from the client (frontend)
    to the server (backend). It will send that infromation to a particular URI, at "/color". 
    Your server will then run the code which is defined in website.py at that route. -->

    <form action="/color" method="post">
        <!-- add the contents of your form here -->
        <label for="name"> Enter a color: </label>
        <input type="text" name="color" id="color" required>
    </form>
